# HR-Dashboard
## Problem Statement
This dashboard aids Atliq Presence Insights in gaining a deeper understanding of their employees. It enables them to comprehend employee behavior related to attendance, including trends and identifies dates and times that affect attendance. Through this tool, they can pinpoint areas needing improvement. Having identified these issues using the dashboard, they can now focus on addressing the factors responsible for them.

## Data Cleansing & Transformation (Power Query)
Data provided in Excel format is currently structured in a pivot table layout, which is not conducive to our data modeling needs. Therefore, we need to transform or "unpivot" the data to suit our requirements better.

## Data Model
Below is a screenshot of the data model after cleansed and prepared tables were read into Power BI.

This data model also shows how FACT_Teble has been connected to  necessary DIM tables.
